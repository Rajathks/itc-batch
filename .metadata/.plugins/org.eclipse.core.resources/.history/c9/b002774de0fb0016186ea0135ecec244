database ==> Relational Model
application ==> Object Model


ORM ( Object Relational Mapping )





 Limitations of JDBC-API
 --------------------------
 
 --> connection management is manual
 --> too many queries for simple operations
 --> too  much duplicate code
 --> jdbc-code partially depened on DBMS product
 
 --> no cache support for frequently used records.
 --> association b/w tables need to be managed manually.
 
 --> poor performance if queries are not optimized..
 
----------------------------------------------------------

solns : using ORM Frameworks


  1. Hibernate ==> JBOSS community  ( much used )
  2. Toplink   ==> Oracle
  3. Eclipselink ==> Eclipse community
  4. iBatis      ==> Apache
  5. JDO
  
  
  Hibernate ==> advantages
  ---------------------------
  
   --> performance  ( thru cache support )
   --> simple to use
   --> most queries are auto generated based on DBMS.
   
  
  ----------------------------------------- 
  
  steps to use Hibernate :
